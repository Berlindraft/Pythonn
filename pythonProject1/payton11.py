# notes file
# the if below helps so that the main function is only called when you call for main and not accidentally
# call for a function outside the main function will generally execute the main function as well because
# that is what being looked for in the compiler
#
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     main()

# assert function
# pytest helps identifies errors and enables us to unit test better certain functions in our code
# instead of python filename.py you can type pytest filename.py
